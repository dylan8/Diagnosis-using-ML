# Diagnosis-using-ML
The objective of this analysis is to assess the impact of feature selection on training and test datasets.

ML techniques used are Information Gain, Forward Sequential Search and Backwards Elimiation

ML classifier used is Gradient Boosting

Two datasets accompany this assignment, SPECT_train.csv and SPECT_test.csv.

The idea is to identify good feature subsets using the training dataset and test these subsets on the test data.
